symple number guessing game in java
"Guess the number" game is a simple game in which a player is asked to guess a random number chosen by the computer within a given range. The player tries to guess the number by making a series of guesses, and the computer provides feedback to the player on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, or until a maximum number of attempts is reached.

The rules of the game can be customized depending on the preferences of the game designer or the player. For example, the range of numbers can be adjusted, the number of attempts can be limited, or the player can be given hints to help them narrow down their guesses. "Guess the number" is a popular game used to teach computer programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and random number generation.
